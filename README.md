# Async_3D_NOC

Asynchronous 3D Network on Chip with Forward Error Detection Correction

•	Designed an Asynchronous Network on Chip with 3D-Mesh as the routing topology.
•	Implemented Forward Error Correction with packet re-routing, Error Detection with Hamming Code. 
•	Designed a Self-Checking test-bench for gauging the performance of the system.
